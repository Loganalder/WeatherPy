# WeatherPy
## Description:
This project included collection of the following items from a JSON file of weather data that was returned upon having made requests to the OpenWeatherMap API for each city in a list of cities that was built by matching nearest cities to randomly selected sets of geographic coordinates using the citipy module:
 
-City

-Country

-Latitude and Longitude

-Maximum temperature

-Humidity

-cloudiness

-Wind speed

-Weather description

The results were converted to a pandas DataFrame, which was saved as a CSV, WeatherPy_Database.csv.
