# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of New PyBer Analysis:
Objectives of this assignment included the following:
1. creation of a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type
2. creation of a multiple-line graph showing total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib
3. submission of the report below, which summarizes how the data differs by city type and how decision-makers at PyBer can use the differences
## Results:
Below is an image of the PyBer Summary DataFrame, which shows how ride-sharing data is affected by the type of city it represents.

Below is an image of the multiple-line chart of total weekly fares for each of the city types, which shows steady PyBer performance was seen in cities across all types between the months of January and April of 2019.

## Summary:
One recommendation would be to encourage drivers in urban cities to drive for suburban or rural cities. An alternative would be to decrease the fares in urban cities. A final alternative would be to encourage riders to tip more generously in Suburban and rural cities.
